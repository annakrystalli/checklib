Welcome to **checklib**&mdash;a library of checklists to aid you in all your software sustainability and reproducibility needs!

## What Are These Checklists?

Have you ever found yourself wondering, "Gosh, I know I'm supposed to be doing [*fill in the blank*], but I haven't the slightest idea where to start."  Our checklists are here to help.  At their core, they are simply [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files containing checklist items we've deemed useful in making sure you're doing the right things in terms of usability, maintainability, extensibility, etc.

## How Do I Use Them?

- [ ] The first step is to go ahead and clone our repository so you have access to the checklists.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/annakrystalli/checklib
   ```

Once you have access to them, how you use them depends on what git hosting service you're using.

In a local copy of your repo use the command line tool to add checklists as issue templates using 

Now when users go to create a new issue through the GitHub interface, they'll be presented with a list of templates from which to choose.  Once they've selected one, the new issue page pops up with the description populated with your brand new checklist.

### GitLab

## Can I Customize Them to Suit My Needs?

Certainly.  Once you've copied them into your repository and they're all set up as issue templates, feel free to customize them to your heart's content.  If you come up with something that would be useful for the research software engineering community at large, please [send it back to us via pull request](CONTRIBUTING.md#submit-pull-requests).
