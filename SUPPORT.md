# checklib Support

We're here to help.  The best way to get support for **checklib** is to [create an issue](https://github.com/annakrystalli/checklib/issues/new/choose).  Choose from any of our issue templates depending on the kind of support you need:
*  **Bug Report:**  What's gone wrong and what do we need to fix?
*  **Discussion:**  Do we just need to talk through something?
*  **Documentation:**  Is something lacking with our documentation?
*  **Feature Request:**  What something awesome we could add to **checklib**?
*  **Question:**  What are you wondering about or having trouble with?

Alternatively, if you'd just like to chat with us, you can join the [Collaborations Workshop 2019 Slack workspace](https://collabw19.slack.com) and join the `#checklib` channel.
